The proposal for this project includes an introduction to the dataset, an outline to our approach and what we hope to do with the
results.
This is found in the "CISC 372 Project Proposal" pdf.

Processing of the data is done in the "write_to_csv" and "Data_Preprocessing" notebooks.

Data visualization and preliminary exploration is done in the "Visualizations" folder.

Feature selection is done in the following notebooks:
- dim_reduction_ent.ipynb
- dim_reduction_rf.ipynb
- RF_dim_reduction.ipynb
- UMAP_experimentation.ipynb
- apply_pca.ipynb
- apply_pca(2).ipynb
Notes and research relating to this work is found in the "Dimensionality Reduction" pdf.

Tested but not final models for the report are:
- Hierarchical_clustering.ipynb
- Hierarchical_clustering3.ipynb
- cluster_kproto.ipynb
- cluster_kproto2.ipynb

The final models used in the report to study the cannabis and nicotine features are the following two notebooks...
1) Hierarchical_clustering2.ipynb
2) mixed_data_clustering.ipynb
